DESCRIPTION: 
 
DELPHIterm  (apologies  to Mike Ward) is a data communications package
that runs on the Tandy Color Computer 3.  A Color Computer 3,  a  disk
drive,  and  a  modem  are  required  to run DELPHIterm.  A printer, a
Deluxe RS23 Pak, and a color monitor would be  very  useful,  but  are
not essential.  
 
DELPHIterm  enables  the user to communicate with another computer via
modem, and to perform uploading and downloading using either  straight
ASCII or XMODEM protocols.  
 
Users  with  a  monochrome  or  color  monitor  may  use  DELPHIterm's
80-column mode.  Others may use DELPHIterm's 40-column mode.  
 
One of DELPHIterm's more unusual features  is  that  it  supports  the
sending  of "strings", or predefined sequences of text.  These strings
may be read into the buffer from  disk,  and  then  referred  to,  and
transmitted, by name.  
 
 
PROGRAMS: 
 
You will find the following programs on your DELPHIterm disk: 
 
     DTERM.DOC   DELPHIterm User's Guide 
     DTERM.BAS   BASIC loader 
     DTERM.BIN   Machine language portion 
      
      
BASIC LOADER 
 
The  BASIC portion of DELPHIterm sets up various parameters, loads the
machine language portion of DELPHIterm, and then starts it up.  
 
Take a look at the BASIC program to see which parameters it  sets  up.
The  comments make things fairly clear.  The foreground and background
color parameters are especially fun to tinker with.  
 
There are two baudrate settings set up by the  BASIC  loader  program:
BAUD  and  BBAUD.   BAUD sets up the baud rate for communication using
the RS232 pak, if it exists.  BBAUD sets the "bitbanger" baudrate  for
the  serial  port at the back of the Color Computer 3.  If you have an
RS232 pak, set BBAUD to reflect the baudrate of your printer.  
 
The setting of a user-definable step rate for your  disk  drive(s)  is

supported.   All drives will work fine with a 30 ms.  step rate.  Most
newer disk drives will work at faster step rates, with 6  ms.    being
the fastest possible.  
 
 
NOTE: 
 
Numerous  references  to  Delphi are made in this document, due to the
fact  that  DELPHIterm  was  originally  uploaded  to  that   service.
DELPHIterm's  author  "hangs out" on Delphi in the CoCo and OS-9 SIGs,
under the username RICKADAMS.
 
 
DELPHITERM COMMANDS: 
 
To invoke one of DELPHIterm's commands, press the ALT key and keep  it
depressed while typing one of the following letters: 
 
H - Help 
 
This command displays a list of DELPHIterm commands.  
 
C - Conference mode on/off 
 
Use  this  command to enter or to exit conference mode.  In conference
mode, an inverse video line will appear at  the  top  of  the  screen.
All  keyboard  input  while in conference mode will appear inside this
inverse video line.  Input  will  also  be  displayed  in  the  normal
screen, unless Delphi's "/noecho" conference command is used.  
 
This  mode  is  useful  in  Delphi conference when it may be otherwise
difficult to see what you are typing due to messages from other  users
becoming interspersed with your input.  
 
U - XMODEM upload from buffer 
 
This  commands starts an XMODEM protocol transmission from your buffer
to your workspace on Delphi.  Start  the  XMODEM  upload  sequence  on
Delphi  first,  via  the  workspace  "xup" command, then use the ALT-U
command to  start  DELPHIterm's  transfer  of  information  from  your
buffer to Delphi.  
 
If,  for  some  reason,  you  want to abort the upload sequence, press
BREAK.  
 
It is assumed that something useful has been loaded  into  the  buffer
before this command is executed.  
 
D - XMODEM download into buffer 
 
This  command  starts  an XMODEM protocol receive into the buffer from
Delphi.  Start the XMODEM download sequence on Delphi first,  via  the
workspace  "xdown"  command,  then  use  the  ALT-D  command  to start
DELPHIterm's transfer of information from Delphi into your buffer.  
 
After the information has been received, you may write it to disk.  






DELPHIterm Users Guide         01/17/87            (c) 1987 Rick Adams

 
You will need to  go  into  your  workspace  on  Delphi  and  use  the
SETTINGS   command  to  change  your  line  terminators  to  CR  ONLY.
Otherwise  your  text  downloads  from  Delphi  will  appear  to    be
doublespaced,  or  sometimes have a strange character at the beginning
of each line.  
 
Press BREAK if, for some reason, you would like to abort the  download
sequence.  
 
R - Read buffer from disk 
 
When  this  command  is executed, DELPHIterm will ask for the filename
of the file from which the contents of the  buffer  are  to  be  read.
Enter the filename, with optional extension and drive specification.  
 
The  default  file  extension  is .TXT, and the default drive is drive
#0.  The filename TEST.BIN:1, for  example,  would  specify  that  the
file  TEST,  with  a file extension of .BIN, was to be read from drive
#1. 
 
The filename TEST would specify the file TEST.TXT was to be read  from
drive  #0,  since  .TXT  is  the default extension and drive #0 is the
default drive.  
 
W - Write buffer/block to disk 
 
To write the contents  of  the  buffer  to  disk,  use  this  command.
DELPHIterm  will ask for the filename of the file to which the current
contents of the buffer are to be written.  Filename defaults, and  the
specification  of  filename extension and disk drive, are specified as
for the ALT-R (read buffer from disk) command.  
 
If a block is currently marked in the buffer (see the ALT-M  command),
that  block  will  be  written.  Otherwise, the entire contents of the
buffer will be sent.  
 
B - Transmit buffer/block 
 
This command transmits the contents of the buffer to the computer  you
are  communicating with.  This command can be used to perform straight
ASCII transfers.  This is the most  straightforward  way  to  transfer
ASCII  text  when the phone line is not introducing any noise, and the
transfer is relatively short.  
 
If a block is currently marked in the buffer (see the ALT-M  command),
that  block  will  be  sent.    Otherwise,  the entire contents of the
buffer will be sent.  
 
The BREAK key may be used to interrupt the transmission, if desired.  
 
O - Open/close buffer 
 
The first time this command is used,  the  buffer  will  be  "opened".
This  means  that  all  data  received will be appended to the buffer.
The message BUFFER OPEN is displayed.  Also, the  cursor  will  change
from  a  blinking  underline  to  a blinking solid block to remind you
that your buffer is open and capturing  your  session  on  the  remote

computer.  
 
If  the  buffer  becomes  full,  the  cursor  will  change  back to an
underline, and the buffer will be closed.  
 
The second time this command is entered, the buffer  will  be  closed.
Data  from  the  remote  system  will  no  longer be "captured" in the
buffer, and the contents of the buffer will be available  for  writing
to disk, etc.  At this time, the message BUFFER CLOSED is displayed.  
 
Further  use  of  this  command  will  "toggle" back and forth between
BUFFER OPEN and BUFFER CLOSED.  
 
S - Send string 
 
To send one of your "strings" to Delphi, as found in the  buffer,  use
this  command.    DELPHIterm  will ask you for the name of the string,
and then send it.  Use BREAK to abort the sending of  the  string,  if
desired.    The  subject of strings is covered in detail later in this
user guide.  
 
P - Print buffer/block 
 
This command causes your printer (if you have one) to  begin  printing
the current contents of the buffer.  
 
If  a block is currently marked in the buffer (see the ALT-M command),
that block will be printed.  Otherwise, the  entire  contents  of  the
buffer will be sent.  
 
Pressing  ALT-P again while the printer is active will abort printing,
if desired.  
 
Only the current contents of the buffer or block at the  time  of  the
ALT-P  command will be printed.  Any further text that may be added to
the buffer in the meantime will not be printed.  
 
L - List available strings 
 
This command lists all available strings that  may  be  found  in  the
buffer.  
 
F - List available files 
 
This  command  will ask for a drive number.  Enter the drive number of
the disk drive for which you wish a list of available files,  followed
by a RETURN.  
 
Z - Send line break 
 
The  ALT-Z command causes a true line break to be sent.  The ALT-BREAK
key sequence also invokes this command.  
 
A line break is useful for those users accessing Delphi  via  TELENET.
It  performs  the  same  function  as control-O ("output off"), but is
much faster.  
 
Line  break  is  sometimes  used  to  perform  some  attention-getting






DELPHIterm Users Guide         01/17/87            (c) 1987 Rick Adams

function on other systems.  
 
K - Kill buffer 
 
This  command  clears the entire contents of the buffer.  All previous
contents of the buffer WILL BE LOST if this command is entered.    The
words "BUFFER CLEARED" are displayed.  
 
V - Enter buffer view mode 
 
Upon  entering buffer view mode, the screen splits into an upper and a
lower window.  
 
Communications continues normally  in  the  lower  window,  while  the
upper window displays the contents of the buffer.  
 
The  up  and  down  arrows  may be used at this point to scroll up and
down in the buffer in the upper window.  Alphabetic keys, etc, may  at
the same time be used to communicate in the lower window.  
 
Shift  down-arrow and shift up-arrow may be used to scroll up and down
in the buffer a screen at a  time.    This  provides  quick  scrolling
through the buffer display.  
 
The  ALT-M  command can be used to mark the beginning and the end of a
"buffer block".  The ALT-W and ALT-B commands ("write buffer to  disk"
and  "send  buffer")  will  transfer  this  buffer  block,  if  it  is
currently "marked".  
 
To exit buffer view mode, press ALT-V again.  
 
M - Mark beginning/end of buffer block 
 
This command only works while "buffer view mode" is active.   Position
the  buffer  display in the upper window so that the first line in the
block to be transferred is the first line of the display.  
 
Then press ALT-M to mark the beginning of the block.  
 
Next, position the buffer display in the  upper  window  so  that  the
first  line  to  be  EXCLUDED  from the block to be transferred is the
first line of the display.  
 
Then press ALT-M to mark the end of the block.  
 
To mark a different block, repeat this sequence.  To erase the  marks,
press ALT-M twice, or exit buffer view mode.  
 
E - Enter buffer entry mode 
 
Entering  buffer  entry  mode causes the screen to split into an upper
and a lower window, similar to the effect of the  ALT-V  (buffer  view
mode) command.  
 
However,  entering  buffer  entry  mode  CLEARS  the  buffer,  and all
subsequent keyboard input is appended to the  buffer  display  in  the
upper window.

Use  the  left-arrow  key  to  backspace.    You  can  use this key to
backspace to the left of the left margin, thus accessing the  previous
line(s), if desired.  
 
When  you  have  entered the message that you want to send, use either
the ALT-B command to send the contents  of  the  buffer,  or  hit  the
BREAK key.  
 
If  the  BREAK key is pressed while in buffer entry mode, the contents
of the buffer will be sent, and then the buffer will be cleared.   You
may then enter another message.  
 
To exit buffer entry mode, press ALT-E again.  
 
Q - Quit DELPHIterm
